eljs: CLI for elementaryJS (Ocelot)
===================================

> run elementaryJS from the comfort of ur CLI instead of the Ocelot Web IDE

## installation

first make sure you have node installed, try [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

    npm isntall

## running

    node index.js <testing | running> <file>

## future

- im aware that the interface sucks. for now i have some aliases like:


        alias eljs='node ~/src/eljs/index.js running "$@"'
        alias teljs='node ~/src/eljs/index.js testing "$@"'

- images!! we've been using images a lot but im not sure how i want to include
them in a CLI like maybe opening them in ImageMagick or something. it'll
probly require modifying lib220 which is no big deal cause it's like 20
lines of code and i know where it is

if you want to help feel free to submit a PR, we're all casual here. you can
also message me any way you know how / open an issue if you have questions /
want to talk about it
